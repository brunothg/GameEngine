Sprites and 9patch images are supported.\r\n\r\nA basic loading screen and SceneObjects for text drawing(LabelObject), animated text drawing(CachedLabelObject)\r\nand sprite rendering(SpriteSceneObject, Sprite2DSceneObject) are ready to use.\r\n\r\nSample programs using this library can be found at: [JellySplush](https://github.com/brunothg/JellySplush) or [RoboBattle](https://github.com/MuesLee/n8dA)\r\n\r\n\r\nJavaDocs can be found at: [GameEngine/javadocs/](http://brunothg.github.io/GameEngine/javadocs/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
